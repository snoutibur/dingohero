# Current step:
Allowing MIDI input to register hit notes, outlined in [[MIDI handler]].
# Minimal Viable Product
- [ ] The [[Note Track]] refers to the interface that shows falling notes and not much more.
- [ ] [[MIDI handler]] deals with the player's input and registering hit notes.
# Gamification
- [ ] [[Scorekeeping]]
