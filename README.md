A somewhat educational rhythm game inspired by Synthesia and the falling note piano tutorials on YouTube.

The intent is to make a more game-like alternative with automatically synced backing tracks.

## Gameplay
### Hardware Setup
Hook up a MIDI keyboard to your computer and the game should automatically detect it and accept input.

Triggering a note on your MIDI keyboard will trigger an input in-game and highlight the key you pressed on the onscreen piano keyboard.

### No Hardware Controller
If you don't have a MIDI keyboard or controller, you can still use your computer keyboard using any program that emulates a MIDI device.

## Maps
Maps are stored in folders as basic MIDI and audio files with a json file that stores map data.

### Creating a map
Because maps are not much more than MIDI, maps can be created with any program that allows MIDI editing such as your favorite DAW.
